  <h2 class="section-heading">How it is built</h2>
  <div class="prose">
    <p>
      The crate uses <strong>spec-driven development</strong>. A living specification in the
      repository&rsquo;s <code>spec/</code> directory is the source of truth for behaviour: every
      behavioural change starts there, then propagates to tests, then code, then docs. When the spec
      and the code disagree, the spec is right and the code is a bug.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every guarantee carries a stable rule ID (<code>R1</code>&ndash;<code>R25</code>), and a
      coverage table maps each rule to the test that enforces it &mdash; and the table itself is
      checked by <code>cargo test</code>, so a rule added without a test, or a section file added
      without an index entry, fails the build rather than waiting for a careful reader. Every crate
      in the family does the same, with its own rule prefix. Plans and tasks live as spec
      sections rather than as separate files, so a roadmap item and the rule it changes sit next to
      each other.

  <div class="callout callout-warning">
    <p>
      This crate handles clinical messages about real patients. Two constraints follow, and they
      shape the whole design:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Absent, empty, and the explicit null stay distinct.</strong> Treating a null as
        empty leaves a withdrawn allergy on a record; treating an empty as a null erases a value
        that was never sent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>A message that arrives correct leaves unchanged.</strong> A silent alteration is
        worse than a visible failure.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      No test, sample, example, or documentation page in this project contains real patient data.
      Every message is synthetic, with obviously fictional names and identifiers.
    </p>

  <h2 class="section-heading">Contributing</h2>
  <div class="prose">
    <p>
      Issues and pull requests are welcome at
      <a href={links.repository}>github.com/er7-rust/er7-rust</a>. Two requests:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Include a synthetic message</strong> that reproduces the problem — never a real one,
        even redacted. A &ldquo;redacted&rdquo; message still carries dates, facility names, and
        identifier formats.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Behavioural changes start in the spec.</strong> The repository&rsquo;s
        <code>AGENTS.md</code> and <code>AGENTS/</code> guides describe the change loop and the
        four checks every change must pass.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If an answer turns out to be &ldquo;this is deliberate&rdquo;, it gets recorded in the
      spec&rsquo;s open-questions section, so the next person finds the reasoning rather than
      re-asking.
    </p>

  <h2 class="section-heading">License</h2>
  <div class="prose">
    <p>
      Multi-licensed. Use it under <strong>any one</strong> of MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-3-Clause,
      GPL-2.0-only, or GPL-3.0-only, at your option. Pick the one that fits your project and comply
      with that one; you do not need to comply with all five, and you do not need to say which you
      chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Healthcare integration code ends up inside organisations with very different legal
      constraints: a permissive license suits a vendor integrating into a proprietary product, while
      a copyleft license suits a public-sector project that wants derivatives kept open. Offering
      the choice means neither has to ask.
