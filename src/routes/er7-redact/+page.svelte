  <div class="prose">
    <p>
      A bug report arrives with a real message attached, and somebody has to turn it into something
      that can be committed to a repository, pasted into a ticket, or fed to a test suite.
      <code>er7-redact</code> does that: a <strong>policy</strong> of HL7 paths and actions, applied
      to a message, plus a report of every position it changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The design constraint is that the redacted message has to survive everything that was going to
      be done to the original. So redaction rewrites <strong>leaf text only</strong>: the same
      segments, fields, repetitions, components, and subcomponents come back out, and every path
      that resolved to a value still resolves to one.

    From a message you cannot share to one you can
  </h2>

  <h3>1. Redact with the built-in policy</h3>
  <pre><code>{`er7-redact message.er7 > redacted.er7`}</code></pre>
  <div class="prose">
    <p>Or, in Rust:</p>
  </div>
  <pre><code>{`use er7_redact::{Policy, Redactor};

let mut message = er7::parse(text)?;
let report = Redactor::new(Policy::patient_identifiers()).redact(&mut message);

println!("{}", message.to_er7());`}</code></pre>
  <div class="prose">
    <p>
      The built-in policy names about forty positions across <code>PID</code>, <code>NK1</code>,
      <code>PV1</code>, <code>GT1</code>, and <code>IN1</code> — the fields that carry a patient
      identifier in every HL7 v2 release from 2.3 to 2.9.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>2. Check what it did, before sharing anything</h3>
  <pre><code>{`er7-redact --report message.er7`}</code></pre>
  <pre><code>{`PID[1]-3[1].1.1  pseudonym
PID[1]-5[1].1.1  replace REDACTED
PID[1]-5[1].2.1  replace REDACTED
PID[1]-5[1].3.1  replace REDACTED
PID[1]-7[1].1.1  first 4`}</code></pre>
  <div class="prose">
    <p>
      One row per position that actually changed, each a fully qualified path you can paste into
      <code>er7 --query</code> to see what is there now. A report carries <strong>no values</strong>
      — not the old text, not the new — so it is safe to paste into a ticket. An empty report means
      nothing was found to redact, which is either good news or a wrong policy.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>3. Say what you want redacted</h3>
  <pre><code>{`er7-redact -r "PID-5 replace REDACTED" -r "PID-7 first 4" message.er7`}</code></pre>
  <div class="prose">
    <p>
      Naming your own rules replaces the built-in policy rather than adding to it, so what runs can
      be predicted from the arguments. In Rust the same policy reads:
    </p>
  </div>
  <pre><code>{`use er7_redact::{Action, Policy};

let policy = Policy::accept_all()
    .with("PID-5", Action::redacted())?
    .with("PID-7", Action::First(4))?;`}</code></pre>
  <div class="prose">
    <p>
      <code>accept_all</code> is the starting point that redacts nothing until a rule says so. Every
      policy states one of two <strong>postures</strong> — accept by default, or reject by default —
      and there is no way to leave it unstated.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="prose">
    <p>
      Paths are <a href="/paths/"><code>er7</code> paths</a>, so everything that notation does works
      here: <code>OBX-5</code> covers every <code>OBX</code> in the message,
      <code>PID-13[2]</code> names one repetition, <code>PID-5.1</code> reaches one component.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>4. Keep the built-in list, and pin it</h3>
  <pre><code>{`er7-redact --show-policy > de-identify.policy   # the built-in list, as a file
$EDITOR de-identify.policy
er7-redact --policy de-identify.policy message.er7`}</code></pre>
  <div class="prose">
    <p>
      The built-in list may <em>grow</em> in a minor release — if a position turns out to carry
      patient detail, waiting for a major version to start redacting it would be the wrong trade —
      so a repository that needs the same redaction next year should check the file in.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>5. When you do not trust the list</h3>
  <pre><code>{`er7-redact --all-but-the-header message.er7`}</code></pre>
  <div class="prose">
    <p>
      Invert the posture: <strong>reject by default</strong>, keep the <code>MSH</code> header so the
      message stays routable, and name what to accept. This is the only thing that covers a local
      <code>Z</code> segment nobody has documented, and the only honest answer to &ldquo;is there
      anything else in there?&rdquo;.
    </p>
  </div>
  <pre><code>{`let policy = Policy::all_but_the_header()
    .with("OBX-2", Action::Keep)?
    .with("OBX-3", Action::Keep)?
    .with("OBX-5", Action::Keep)?;`}</code></pre>
  <div class="prose">
    <p>
      A <code>keep</code> rule <strong>accepts</strong> the position it names; any other action
      <strong>rejects</strong> it. Where a position is named by both, the reject wins — whichever
      order the two rules are in, and at whatever depth. A field in both lists is a policy somebody
      got wrong, and redacting it is the direction that fails safely.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>--reject-all</code> goes one step further and takes the header too, which leaves the
      message unroutable. Reach for it when nothing about the input is trusted.

  <h3>The nine actions</h3>
  <div class="table-wrap">
    <table class="table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Written</th>
          <th><code>PATID1234</code> becomes</th>
          <th>Use for</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {#each actions as action (action.written)}
          <tr>
            <td><code>{action.written}</code></td>
            <td><code>{action.becomes}</code></td>
            <td>{action.use}</td>
          </tr>
        {/each}
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
  <div class="prose">
    <p>
      <code>clear</code> and <code>null</code> are not interchangeable. An empty field says
      &ldquo;the sender said nothing about this&rdquo;; <code>""</code> says &ldquo;delete your
      stored value&rdquo;. A redacted copy for testing should not be telling anything to delete a
      record.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>The policy file</h3>
  <pre><code>{`# de-identify.policy

PID-3.1  pseudonym          # keep linkage, lose the record number
PID-5    replace REDACTED
PID-7    first 4            # a birth date reduced to its year
PID-11   clear
NTE-3    clear              # free text, where identifiers hide

accept                      # ...or "reject ACTION" for the other posture
unrecognised  refuse        # a payload that is not ER7 fails the run
known-values on             # sweep every repeat of a value already redacted`}</code></pre>
  <div class="prose">
    <p>
      One rule per line: a path, whitespace, an action. Blank lines are ignored, <code>#</code>
      starts a comment, and rules apply <strong>in order</strong>. Four reserved first words —
      <code>accept</code>, <code>reject</code>, <code>unrecognised</code>, and
      <code>known-values</code> — set what the policy does by default rather than naming a
      position, and a policy written back out states all of them, so a reader never has to infer
      which default was the quiet one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>known-values on</code> (the default) sweeps every position for a value already
      redacted at a named position elsewhere in the same message, case-insensitively and on whole
      words; <code>known-values off</code> turns that sweep off, so only the rules themselves act.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>reject ACTION</code> turns the policy from &ldquo;redact these&rdquo; into &ldquo;redact
      everything except these&rdquo;, and <code>keep</code> is how a position is accepted back out
      of it. <code>unrecognised</code> covers input that is not ER7 at all: it has no positions in
      it, so no rule can speak to it, and the policy says outright whether it is refused, passed
      through, or masked whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      A malformed line is refused at load time, with the line number. That strictness is deliberate:
      a typo in a policy means a value that silently was not redacted.
    </p>

        {#each options as option (option.flag)}

      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>

  <h3>Pseudonyms</h3>
  <div class="prose">
    <p>
      Clearing an identifier destroys the message as test data: nothing ties the patient here to the
      same patient in the next message. <code>pseudonym</code> replaces it with a stable stand-in
      instead, so every message redacted with the same key maps
      <code>PATID1234</code> the same way, and different keys produce unrelated mappings.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="callout">
    <p>
      <strong>A pseudonym is not a cryptographic guarantee.</strong> It is a keyed hash that
      preserves equality on purpose — that is what makes messages joinable, and it is also what
      leaks. Anyone holding the key can invert the mapping by trying every candidate identifier, and
      record numbers come from small spaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use it inside your own trust boundary — test environments, reproductions, CI fixtures. For
      data leaving it, use <code>clear</code> or <code>replace</code>, which leak nothing but the
      fact that a value was there.

      <strong>This is a positional editor, not a compliance tool.</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It cannot tell you whether the result is de-identified. That is a judgement about a whole
        data set, its recipients, and what else they hold — made by a person who is accountable for
        it.
      </li>
      <li>
        It does not know which positions <em>your</em> senders use. Run
        <code>er7 message.er7</code> and read what is actually in there before trusting any policy,
        including the built-in one.
      </li>
      <li>
        It does not find an identifier written into free text <strong>unless that exact value
        already turned up at a named position</strong> — the known-values sweep catches a repeat,
        not a first mention. A name that appears in an <code>NTE-3</code> comment and nowhere else
        still survives every positional policy; name that position explicitly, or reject by
        default.

      <li>There is no way back: no mapping table, no key escrow, no undo.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A message this crate has redacted is a message with less in it, which is progress, and is not
      the same thing as a safe one.
